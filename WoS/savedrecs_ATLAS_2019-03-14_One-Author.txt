TI Properties of g -> bb at small opening angles in pp collisions
   with the ATLAS detector at √s=13 TeV
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The fragmentation of high-energy gluons at small opening angles is largely unconstrained by present measurements. Gluon splitting to b-quark pairs is a unique probe into the properties of gluon fragmentation because identified b-tagged jets provide a proxy for the quark daughters of the initial gluon. In this study, key differential distributions related to the g -> bb process are measured using 33 fb(-1) of √s=13 TeV pp collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2016. Jets constructed from charged-particle tracks, clustered with the anti-k(t) jet algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.2, are used to probe angular scales below the R = 0.4 jet radius. The observables are unfolded to particle level in order to facilitate direct comparisons with predictions from present and future simulations. Multiple significant differences are observed between the data and parton shower Monte Carlo predictions, providing input to improve these predictions of the main source of background events in analyses involving boosted Higgs bosons decaying into b-quarks.

TI Search for heavy long-lived multicharged particles in proton-proton
   collisions at √s=13 TeV using the ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A search for heavy long-lived multicharged particles is performed using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Data with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1) collected in 2015 and 2016 from proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV are examined. Particles producing anomalously high ionization, consistent with long-lived massive particles with electric charges from vertical bar q vertical bar = 2e to vertical bar q vertical bar = 7e, are searched for. No events are observed, and 95% confidence level cross-section upper limits are interpreted as lower mass limits for a Drell-Yan production model. Multicharged particles with masses between 50 and 980-1220 GeV (depending on their electric charge) are excluded.

TI Search for Higgs boson decays into a pair of light bosons in the bb mu
   mu final state in pp collision at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB A search for decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of new spin-zero particles, H -> aa, where the a-bosons decay into a b-quark pair and a muon pair, is presented. The search uses 36.1 fb(-1) of proton-proton collision data at √s=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. No significant deviation from the Standard Model prediction is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the branching ratio (sigma(H)/sigma(SM)) x B(H -> aa -> bb mu mu), ranging from 1.2 x 10(-4) to 8.4 x 10(-4) in the a-boson mass range of 20-60 GeV. Model-independent limits are set on the visible production cross-section times the branching ratio to the bb mu mu final state for new physics, sigma(vis)(X) x B(X -> bb mu mu), ranging from 0.1 fb to 0.73 fb for m(mu mu) between 18 and 62 GeV.

TI Measurement of the nuclear modification factor for inclusive jets in Pb
   plus Pb collisions at √s(NN)=5.02 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Measurements of the yield and nuclear modification factor, R-AA, for inclusive jet production are performed using 0.49 nb(-1) of Pb+Pb data at √s(NN)=5.02 TeV and 25 pb(-1) of Pb+Pb data at √s=5.02 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-k(t) algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4 and are measured over the transverse momentum range of 40-1000 GeV in six rapidity intervals covering vertical bar y vertical bar < 2.8. The magnitude of R-AA increases with increasing jet transverse momentum, reaching a value of approximately 0.6 at 1 TeV in the most central collisions. The magnitude of R-AA also increases towards peripheral collisions. The value of R-AA is independent of rapidity at low jet transverse momenta, but it is observed to decrease with increasing rapidity at high transverse momenta.

TI Study of the hard double-parton scattering contribution to inclusive
   four-lepton production in pp collisions at √s=8 TeV with the ATLAS
   detector
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB The inclusive production of four isolated charged leptons in pp collisions is analysed for the presence of hard double-parton scattering, using 20.2 fb(-1) of data recorded in the ATLAS detector at the LHC at centre-of-mass energy √s=8 TeV. In the four-lepton invariant-mass range of 80 < m(4l) < 1000 GeV, an artificial neural network is used to enhance the separation between single- and double-parton scattering based on the kinematics of the four leptons in the final state. An upper limit on the fraction of events originating from double-parton scattering is determined at 95% confidence level to be f(DPS) = 0.042, which results in an estimated lower limit on the effective cross section at 95% confidence level of 1.0 mb.

TI Measurement of the photon identification efficiencies with the ATLAS
   detector using LHC Run 2 data collected in 2015 and 2016
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The efficiency of the photon identification criteria in the ATLAS detector is measured using 36.1 fb1 to 36.7 fb1 of pp collision data at √s=13 TeV collected in 2015 and 2016. The efficiencies are measured separately for converted and unconverted isolated photons, in four different pseudorapidity regions, for transverse momenta between 10 GeV and 1.5 TeV. The results from the combination of three data-driven techniques are compared with the predictions from simulation after correcting the variables describing the shape of electromagnetic showers in simulation for the average differences observed relative to data. Data-tosimulation efficiency ratios are determined to account for the small residual efficiency differences. These factors are measured with uncertainties between 0.5% and 5% depending on the photon transverse momentum and pseudorapidity. The impact of the isolation criteria on the photon identification efficiency, and that of additional soft pp interactions, are also discussed. The probability of reconstructing an electron as a photon candidate ismeasured in data, and compared with the predictions from simulation. The efficiency of the reconstruction of photon conversions is measured using a sample of photon candidates from Z. mu mu. events, exploiting the properties of the ratio of the energies deposited in the first and second longitudinal layers of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter.

TI Electron and photon energy calibration with the ATLAS detector using
   2015-2016 LHC proton-proton collision data
SO JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION
AB This paper presents the electron and photon energy calibration obtained with the ATLAS detector using about 36 fb(-1) of LHC proton-proton collision data recorded at √s=13 TeV in 2015 and 2016. The different calibration steps applied to the data and the optimization of the reconstruction of electron and photon energies are discussed. The absolute energy scale is set using a large sample of Z boson decays into electron-positron pairs. The systematic uncertainty in the energy scale calibration varies between 0.03% to 0.2% in most of the detector acceptance for electrons with transverse momentum close to 45 GeV. For electrons with transverse momentum of 10 GeV the typical uncertainty is 0.3% to 0.8% and it varies between 0.25% and 1% for photons with transverse momentum around 60 GeV. Validations of the energy calibration with J/psi -> e(+)e(-) decays and radiative Z boson decays are also presented.

TI In situ calibration of large-radius jet energy and mass in
   13TeV proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The response of the ATLAS detector to large-radius jets is measured in situ using 36.2 fb(-1) of √s=13 TeV proton-proton collisions provided by the LHC and recorded by the ATLAS experiment during 2015 and 2016. The jet energy scale is measured in events where the jet recoils against a reference object, which can be either a calibrated photon, a reconstructed Z boson, or a system of well-measured small-radius jets. The jet energy resolution and a calibration of forward jets are derived using dijet balance measurements. The jet mass response is measured with two methods: using mass peaks formed by W bosons and top quarks with large transverse momenta and by comparing the jet mass measured using the energy deposited in the calorimeter with that using the momenta of charged-particle tracks. The transverse momentum and mass responses in simulations are found to be about 2-3% higher than in data. This difference is adjusted for with a correction factor. The results of the different methods are combined to yield a calibration over a large range of transverse momenta (p(T)). The precision of the relative jet energy scale is 1-2% for 200 GeV < p(T) < TeV, while that of the mass scale is 2-10%. The ratio of the energy resolutions in data and simulation is measured to a precision of 10-15% over the same p(T) range.

AB Measurements of fiducial integrated and differential cross sections for inclusive W +, W -and Z boson production are reported. They are based on 25.0 +/- 0.5 pb -1 of pp collision data at v s = 5.02 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Electron and muon decay channels are analysed, and the combined W +, W -and Z integrated cross sections are found to be sW+ = 2266 +/- 9 (stat) +/- 29 (syst) +/- 43 (lumi) pb, sW-= 1401 +/- 7 (stat) +/- 18 (syst) +/- 27 (lumi) pb, and sZ = 374.5 +/- 3.4 (stat)+/- 3.6 (syst)+/- 7.0 (lumi) pb, in good agreement with next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD crosssection calculations. These measurements serve as references for Pb+ Pb interactions at the LHC at v sNN = 5.02 TeV.

TI Measurement of photon-jet transverse momentum correlations in 5.02 TeV
   Pb + Pb and pp collisions with ATLAS
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Jets created in association with a photon can be used as a calibrated probe to study energy loss in the medium created in nuclear collisions. Measurements of the transverse momentum balance between isolated photons and inclusive jets are presented using integrated luminosities of 0.49 nb(-1) of Pb + Pb collision data at √s(NN)=5.02 TeV and 25 pb(-1) of pp collision data at √s=5.02 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Photons with transverse momentum 63.1 < p(T)(gamma) < 200 GeV and vertical bar eta(gamma vertical bar) < 2.37 are paired with all jets in the event that have p(T)(jet) > 31.6 GeV and pseudorapidity vertical bar eta(Jet)vertical bar < 2.8. The transverse momentum balance given by the jet-to-photon p(T) ratio, x(j gamma), is measured for pairs with azimuthal opening angle Delta phi > 7 pi/8. Distributions of the per-photon jet yield as a function of x(j gamma), (1/N-gamma)(dN/dx(j gamma)), are corrected for detector effects via a two-dimensional unfolding procedure and reported at the particle level. In pp collisions, the distributions are well described by Monte Carlo event generators. In Pb + Pb collisions, the x(j gamma) distribution is modified from that observed in pp collisions with increasing centrality, consistent with the picture of parton energy loss in the hot nuclear medium. The data are compared with a suite of energy-loss models and calculations.

TI Correlated long-range mixed-harmonic fluctuations measured in pp, p plus
   Pb and low-multiplicity Pb plus Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Correlations of two flow harmonics v(n) and v(m) via three- and four-particle cumulants are measured in 13 TeV pp, 5.02 TeV p+Pb, and 2.76 TeV peripheral Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The goal is to understand the multi-particle nature of the long-range collective phenomenon in these collision systems. The large non-flow background from dijet production present in the standard cumulant method is suppressed using a method of subevent cumulants involving two, three and four subevents separated in pseudorapidity. The results show a negative correlation between v(2) and v(3) and a positive correlation between v(2) and v(4) for all collision systems and over the full multiplicity range. However, the magnitudes of the correlations are found to depend on the event multiplicity, the choice of transverse momentum range and collision system. The relative correlation strength, obtained by normalisation of the cumulants with the < v(n)(2)> from a two-particle correlation analysis, is similar in the three collision systems and depends weakly on the event multiplicity and transverse momentum. These results based on the subevent methods provide strong evidence of a similar long-range multi-particle collectivity in pp, p+Pb and peripheral Pb+Pb collisions.

TI A strategy for a general search for new phenomena using data-derived
   signal regions and its application within the ATLAS experiment
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB This paper describes a strategy for a general search used by the ATLAS Collaboration to find potential indications of new physics. Events are classified according to their final state into many event classes. For each event class an automated search algorithm tests whether the data are compatible with the Monte Carlo simulated expectation in several distributions sensitive to the effects of new physics. The significance of a deviation is quantified using pseudo-experiments. A data selection with a significant deviation defines a signal region for a dedicated follow-up analysis with an improved background expectation. The analysis of the data-derived signal regions on a new dataset allows a statistical interpretation without the large look-elsewhere effect. The sensitivity of the approach is discussed using Standard Model processes and benchmark signals of new physics. As an example, results are shown for 3.2fb-1 of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015, in which more than 700 event classes and more than 105 regions have been analysed. No significant deviations are found and consequently no data-derived signal regions for a follow-up analysis have been defined.

TI Search for doubly charged scalar bosons decaying into same-sign W boson

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB A search for doubly charged scalar bosons decaying into W boson pairs is presented. It uses a data sample from proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1fb-1 collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV in 2015 and 2016. This search is guided by a model that includes an extension of the Higgs sector through a scalar triplet, leading to a rich phenomenology that includes doubly charged scalar bosons H +/-+/-. Those bosons are produced in pairs in proton-proton collisions and decay predominantly into electroweak gauge bosons H +/-+/- W +/- W +/-. Experimental signatures with several leptons, missing transverse energy and jets are explored. No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are found. The parameter space of the benchmark model is excluded at 95% confidence level for H +/-+/- bosons with masses between 200 and 220 GeV.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A search for supersymmetry in events with large missing transverse momentum, jets, and at least one hadronically decaying tau-lepton is presented. Two exclusive final states with either exactly one or at least two tau-leptons are considered. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1) delivered by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. No significant excess is observed over the Standard Model expectation. At 95% confidence level, model-independent upper limits on the cross section are set and exclusion limits are provided for two signal scenarios: a simplified model of gluino pair production with tau-rich cascade decays, and a model with gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB). In the simplified model, gluino masses up to 2000 GeV are excluded for low values of the mass of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), while LSP masses up to 1000 GeV are excluded for gluino masses around 1400 GeV. In the GMSB model, values of the supersymmetry-breaking scale are excluded below 110 TeV for all values of tan beta in the range 2 <= tan beta <= 60, and below 120 TeV for tan beta > 30.

TI Search for pairs of highly collimated photon-jets in pp collisions at
   √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Results of a search for the pair production of photon-jets-collimated groupings of photons-in the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider are reported. Highly collimated photon-jets can arise from the decay of new, highly boosted particles that can decay to multiple photons collimated enough to be identified in the electromagnetic calorimeter as a single, photonlike energy cluster. Data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.7 fb(-1), were collected in 2015 and 2016. Candidate photon-jet pair production events are selected from those containing two reconstructed photons using a set of identification criteria much less stringent than that typically used for the selection of photons, with additional criteria applied to provide improved sensitivity to photon-jets. Narrow excesses in the reconstructed diphoton mass spectra are searched for. The observed mass spectra are consistent with the Standard Model background expectation. The results are interpreted in the context of a model containing a new, high-mass scalar particle with narrow width, X, that decays into pairs of photon-jets via new, light particles, a. Upper limits are placed on the cross section times the product of branching ratios sigma x B(X -> aa) x B(a -> gamma gamma)(2) for 200 GeV < m(X) < 2 TeV and for ranges of m(a) from a lower mass of 100 MeV up to between 2 and 10 GeV, depending upon m(X). Upper limits are also placed on sigma x B(X -> aa) x B(a -> 3 pi(0))(2) for the same range of m(X) and for ranges of m(a) from a lower mass of 500 MeV up to between 2 and 10 GeV.

TI Search for heavy charged long-lived particles in proton-proton
   collisions at √s=13 TeV using an ionisation measurement with the

SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB This Letter presents a search for heavy charged long-lived particles produced in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV at the LHC using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1) collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2015 and 2016. These particles are expected to travel with a velocity significantly below the speed of light, and therefore have a specific ionisation higher than any high-momentum Standard Model particle of unit charge. The pixel subsystem of the ATLAS detector is used in this search to measure the ionisation energy loss of all reconstructed charged particles which traverse the pixel detector. Results are interpreted assuming the pair production of R-hadrons as composite colourless states of a long-lived gluino and Standard Model partons. No significant deviation from Standard Model background expectations is observed, and lifetime-dependent upper limits on R-hadron production cross-sections and gluino masses are set, assuming the gluino always decays to two quarks and a 100 GeV stable neutralino. R-hadrons with lifetimes above 1.0 ns are excluded at the 95% confidence level, with lower limits on the gluino mass ranging between 1290 GeV and 2060 GeV. In the case of stable R-hadrons, the lower limit on the gluino mass at the 95% confidence level is 1890 GeV.

Resonance candidates are identified as massive large-radius jets with substructure consistent with a particle decaying into a quark pair. The mass spectrum of the candidates is examined for local excesses above background. No evidence of a new resonance is observed in the data, which are used to exclude the production of a lepto-phobic axial-vector Z' boson.

For right-handed W' bosons with coupling to the SM particles equal to the SM weak coupling constant, masses below 3.15 TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level. This search is also combined with a previously published ATLAS result for W'-> tb in the fully hadronic final state. Using the combined searches, right-handed W' bosons with masses below 3.25 TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level.

SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A search for heavy right-handed Majorana or Dirac neutrinos N (R) and heavy right-handed gauge bosons W (R) is performed in events with a pair of energetic electrons or muons, with the same or opposite electric charge, and two energetic jets. The events are selected from pp collision data with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1) collected by the ATLAS detector at TeV. No significant deviations from the Standard Model are observed. The results are interpreted within the theoretical framework of a left-right symmetric model and lower limits are set on masses in the heavy right-handed W boson and neutrino mass plane. The excluded region extends to TeV for both Majorana and Dirac N (R) neutrinos.

TI Search for pair production of Higgs bosons in the
   bbbb final state using proton-proton collisions at
   √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A search for Higgs boson pair production in the bbbb final state is carried out with up to 36.1 fb(-1) of LHC proton-proton collision data collected at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. Three benchmark signals are studied: a spin-2 graviton decaying into a Higgs boson pair, a scalar resonance decaying into a Higgs boson pair, and Standard Model non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. Two analyses are carried out, each implementing a particular technique for the event reconstruction that targets Higgs bosons reconstructed as pairs of jets or single boosted jets. The resonance mass range covered is 260-3000 GeV. The analyses are statistically combined and upper limits on the production cross section of Higgs boson pairs times branching ratio to bbbb are set in each model. No significant excess is observed; the largest deviation of data over prediction is found at a mass of 280 GeV, corresponding to 2.3 standard deviations globally. The observed 95% confidence level upper limit on the non-resonant production is 13 times the Standard Model prediction.

TI Search for long-lived particles in final states with displaced dimuon
   vertices in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A search is performed for a long-lived particle decaying into a final state that includes a pair of muons of opposite-sign electric charge, using proton-proton collision data collected at √s=13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 32.9 fb(-1). No significant excess over the Standard Model expectation is observed. Limits at 95% confidence level on the lifetime of the long-lived particle are presented in models of new phenomena including gauge-mediated supersymmetry or decay of the Higgs boson, H, to a pair of dark photons, Z(D). Lifetimes in the range c tau = 1-2400 cm are excluded, depending on the parameters of the model. In the supersymmetric model, the lightest neutralino is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle, with a relatively long lifetime due to its weak coupling to the gravitino, the lightest supersymmetric particle. The lifetime limits are determined for very light gravitino mass and various assumptions for the neutralino mass in the range 300-1000 GeV. In the dark photon model, the lifetime limits are interpreted as exclusion contours in the plane of the coupling between the Z(D) and the Standard Model Z boson versus the Z(D) mass (in the range 20-60 GeV), for various assumptions for the H -> Z(D)Z(D) branching fraction.

TI Search for pair and single production of vectorlike quarks in final
   states with at least one Z boson decaying into a pair of electrons or
   muons in pp collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at
   √s=13 TeV
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A search for vectorlike quarks is presented, which targets their decay into a Z boson and a third-generation Standard Model quark. In the case of a vectorlike quark T (B) with charge +2/3e (-1/3e), the decay searched for is T -> Zt (B -> Zb). Data for this analysis were taken during 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1) of pp collisions at √s=13 TeV. The final state used is characterized by the presence of b-tagged jets, as well as a Z boson with high transverse momentum, which is reconstructed from a pair of opposite-sign same-flavor leptons. Pair and single production of vectorlike quarks are both taken into account and are each searched for using optimized dileptonic exclusive and trileptonic inclusive event selections. In these selections, the high scalar sum of jet transverse momenta, the presence of high-transverse-momentum large-radius jets, as well as-in the case of the single-production selections-the presence of forward jets are used. No significant excess over the background-only hypothesis is found and exclusion limits at 95% confidence level allow masses of vectorlike quarks of m(T) > 1030 GeV (m(T) > 1210 GeV) and m(B) > 1010 GeV (m(B) > 1140 GeV) in the singlet (doublet) model. In the case of 100% branching ratio for T -> Zt (B -> Zb), the limits are m(T) > 1340 GeV (m(B) > 1220 GeV). Limits at 95% confidence level are also set on the coupling to Standard Model quarks for given vectorlike quark masses.

TI Measurement of the azimuthal anisotropy of charged particles produced in
   √s(NN)=5.02 TeV Pb+ Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy in lead-lead collisions at v s NN = 5.02 TeV are presented using a data sample corresponding to 0.49 nb -1 integrated luminosity collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015. The recorded minimum-bias sample is enhanced by triggers for " ultra-central" collisions, providing an opportunity to perform detailed study of flow harmonics in the regime where the initial state is dominated by fluctuations. The anisotropy of the charged-particle azimuthal angle distributions is characterized by the Fourier coefficients, v2-v7, which are measured using the two-particle correlation, scalar-product and event-plane methods. The goal of the paper is to provide measurements of the differential as well as integrated flow harmonics vn over wide ranges of the transverse momentum, 0.5 < pT < 60 GeV, the pseudorapidity, |.| < 2.5, and the collision centrality 0-80%. Results from different methods are compared and discussed in the context of previous and recent measurements in Pb+ Pb collisions at v s NN = 2.76TeV and 5.02TeV. In particular, the shape of the pT dependence of elliptic or triangular flow harmonics is observed to be very similar at different centralities after scaling the vn and pT values by constant factors over the centrality interval 0-60% and the pT range 0.5 < pT < 5 GeV.

AB A search for new phenomena in events with two same- charge leptons or three leptons and jets identified as originating from b-quarks in a data sample of 36.1 fb of pp collisions at √s=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider is reported. No significant excess is found and limits are set on vector-like quark, four top-quark, and same-sign top-quark pair production. The observed (expected) 95% CL mass limits for a vector-like T- and B- quark singlet are mT > 0 : 98 ( 0 : 99) TeV and mB > 1 : 00 ( 1 : 01) TeV respectively. Limits on the production of the vector-like T5/3 quark are also derived considering both pair and single production; in the former case the lower limit on the mass of the T5/3 quark is (expected to be) 1.19 (1.21) TeV. The Standard Model four top-quark production cross-section upper limit is (expected to be) 69 (29) fb. Constraints are also set on exotic four-top quark production models. Finally, limits are set on same sign top-quark pair production. The upper limit on uu ! tt production is (expected to be) 89 (59) fb for a mediator mass of 1 TeV, and a dark-matter interpretation is also derived, excluding a mediator of 3 TeV with a dark-sector coupling of 1.0 and a coupling to ordinary matter above 0.31.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB A search for the electroweak production of charginos, neutralinos and sleptons decaying into final states involving two or three electrons or muons is presented. The analysis is based on 36.1 fb(-1) of √s=13 TeV protonproton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Several scenarios based on simplified models are considered. These include the associated production of the next-to-lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino, followed by their decays into final states with leptons and the lightest neutralino via either sleptons or Standard Model gauge bosons; direct production of chargino pairs, which in turn decay into leptons and the lightest neutralino via intermediate sleptons; and slepton pair production, where each slepton decays directly into the lightest neutralino and a lepton. No significant deviations from the Standard Model expectation are observed and stringent limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the masses of relevant supersymmetric particles in each of these scenarios. For a massless lightest neutralino, masses up to 580 GeV are excluded for the associated production of the next-to-lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino, assuming gauge-boson mediated decays, whereas for slepton-pair production masses up to 500 GeV are excluded assuming three generations of mass-degenerate sleptons.

SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The production of Z bosons in association with a high-energy photon (Z production) is studied in the neutrino decay channel of the Z boson using pp collisions at 13 TeV. The analysis uses a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 36.1fb(-1) collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. Candidate Z events with invisible decays of the Z boson are selected by requiring significant transverse momentum (p(T)) of the dineutrino system in conjunction with a single isolated photon with large transverse energy (E-T). The rate of Z production is measured as a function of photon E-T, dineutrino system p(T) and jet multiplicity. Evidence of anomalous triple gauge-boson couplings is sought in Z production with photon E-T greater than 600 GeV. No excess is observed relative to the Standard Model expectation, and upper limits are set on the strength of ZZ and Z couplings

TI Comparison between simulated and observed LHC beam backgrounds in the
   ATLAS experiment at E-beam=4 TeV
SO JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION
AB Results of dedicated Monte Carlo simulations of beam-induced background (BIB) in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are presented and compared with data recorded in 2012. During normal physics operation this background arises mainly from scattering of the 4 TeV protons on residual gas in the beam pipe. Methods of reconstructing the BIB signals in the ATLAS detector, developed and implemented in the simulation chain based on the FLUKA Monte Carlo simulation package, are described. The interaction rates are determined from the residual gas pressure distribution in the LHC ring in order to set an absolute scale on the predicted rates of BIB so that they can be compared quantitatively with data. Through these comparisons the origins of the BIB leading to different observables in the ATLAS detectors are analysed. The level of agreement between simulation results and BIB measurements by ATLAS in 2012 demonstrates that a good understanding of the origin of BIB has been reached.

TI Operation and performance of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter in Run 1
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The Tile Calorimeter is the hadron calorimeter covering the central region of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Approximately 10,000 photomultipliers collect light from scintillating tiles acting as the active material sandwiched between slabs of steel absorber. This paper gives an overview of the calorimeter's performance during the years 2008-2012 using cosmic-ray muon events and proton-proton collision data at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV with a total integrated luminosity of nearly 30 fb(-1). The signal reconstruction methods, calibration systems as well as the detector operation status are presented. The energy and time calibration methods performed excellently, resulting in good stability of the calorimeter response under varying conditions during the LHC Run 1. Finally, the Tile Calorimeter response to isolated muons and hadrons as well as to jets from proton-proton collisions is presented. The results demonstrate excellent performance in accord with specifications mentioned in the Technical Design Report.

Therefore, combined 95% confidence-level upper limits are set on the production cross section for a range of vectorlike quark scenarios, significantly improving upon the reach of the individual searches. Model-independent limits are set assuming the vectorlike quarks decay to standard model particles. A singlet T is excluded for masses below 1.31 TeV and a singlet B is excluded for masses below 1.22 TeV. Assuming a weak isospin (T, B) doublet and vertical bar V-Tb vertical bar << vertical bar V-tB vertical bar, T and B masses below 1.37 TeV are excluded.

TI Search for chargino-neutralino production using recursive jigsaw
   reconstruction in final states with two or three charged leptons in

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A search for electroweak production of supersymmetric particles is performed in two-lepton and three-lepton final states using recursive jigsaw reconstruction, a technique that assigns reconstructed objects to the most probable hemispheres of the decay trees, allowing one to construct tailored kinematic variables to separate the signal and background. The search uses data collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS experiment in √s=13 TeV proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1). Chargino-neutralino pair production, with decays via W/Z bosons, is studied in final states involving leptons and jets and missing transverse momentum for scenarios with large and intermediate mass splittings between the parent particle and lightest supersymmetric particle, as well as for the scenario where this mass splitting is close to the mass of the Z boson. The latter case is challenging since the vector bosons are produced with kinematic properties that are similar to those in Standard Model processes. Results are found to be compatible with the Standard Model expectations in the signal regions targeting large and intermediate mass splittings, and chargino-neutralino masses up to 600 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for a massless lightest supersymmetric particle. Excesses of data above the expected background are found in the signal regions targeting low mass splittings, and the largest local excess amounts to 3.0 standard deviations.

AB This Letter presents a measurement of gamma gamma -> mu(+)mu(-)- production in Pb + Pb collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at √s(NN)=5.02 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 0.49 nb(-1). The azimuthal angle and transverse momentum correlations between the muons are measured as a function of collision centrality. The muon pairs are produced from gamma gamma through the interaction of the large electromagnetic fields of the nuclei. The contribution from background sources of muon pairs is removed using a template fit method. In peripheral collisions, the muons exhibit a strong back-to-back correlation consistent with previous measurements of muon pair production in ultraperipheral collisions. The angular correlations are observed to broaden significantly in central collisions. The modifications arc qualitatively consistent with rescattering of the muons while passing through the hot matter produced in the collision.

AB Direct searches for lepton flavor violation in decays of the Z boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC are presented. Decays of the Z boson into an electron or muon and a hadronically decaying r lepton are considered. The searches are based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1) at a center-of-mass energy of √s=13 TeV. No statistically significant excess of events above the expected background is observed, and upper limits on the branching ratios of lepton-flavor-violating decays are set at the 95% confidence level: B(Z -> e tau) < 5.8 x 10(-5) and B(Z -> mu tau) < 2.4 x 10(-5). This is the first limit on B(Z -> e tau) with ATLAS data. The upper limit on 13(Z -> mu tau) is combined with a previous ATLAS result based on 20.3 fb(-1) of proton proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of √s=8 TeV and the combined upper limit at 95% confidence level is B(Z -> mu tau) < 1.3 x 10(-5).

SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A search for charged Higgs bosons heavier than the top quark and decaying via H-+/- tb is presented. The data analysed corresponds to 36.1 fb(-1) of pp collisions at TeV and was recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. The production of a charged Higgs boson in association with a top quark and a bottom quark, pp tbH(+/-), is explored in the mass range from m(H)+/- = 200 to 2000 GeV using multi-jet final states with one or two electrons or muons. Events are categorised according to the multiplicity of jets and how likely these are to have originated from hadronisation of a bottom quark. Multivariate techniques are used to discriminate between signal and background events. No significant excess above the background-only hypothesis is observed and exclusion limits are derived for the production cross-section times branching ratio of a charged Higgs boson as a function of its mass, which range from 2.9 pb at m(H)+/- = 200 GeV to 0.070 pb at m(H)+/- = 2000 GeV. The results are interpreted in two benchmark scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.

AB A combined measurement of differential and inclusive total cross sections of Higgs boson production is performed using 36.1 fb(-1) of 13 TeV proton-proton collision data produced by the LHC and recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. Cross sections are obtained from measured H -> gamma gamma and H -> ZZ* -> 4l event yields, which are combined taking into account detector efficiencies, resolution, acceptances and branching fractions. The total Higgs boson production cross section is measured to be 57.0(-5.9)(+6.0) (stat.) (+4.0)(-3.3) (syst.) pb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction. Differential cross-section measurements are presented for the Higgs boson transverse momentum distribution, Higgs boson rapidity, number of jets produced together with the Higgs boson, and the transverse momentum of the leading jet. The results from the two decay channels are found to be compatible, and their combination agrees with the Standard Model predictions.
