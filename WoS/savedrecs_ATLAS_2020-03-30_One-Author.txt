TI Search for long-lived neutral particles produced in pp collisions at
   √s=13 TeV decaying into displaced hadronic jets in the ATLAS inner
   detector and muon spectrometer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A search is presented for pair production of long-lived neutral particles using 33 fb(-1) of √s=13 TeV proton-proton collision data, collected during 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. This search focuses on a topology in which one long-lived particle decays in the ATLAS inner detector and the other decays in the muon spectrometer. Special techniques are employed to reconstruct the displaced tracks and vertices in the inner detector and in the muon spectrometer. One event is observed that passes the full event selection, which is consistent with the estimated background. Limits are placed on scalar boson propagators with masses from 125 GeV to 1000 GeV decaying into pairs of long-lived hidden-sector scalars with masses from 8 GeV to 400 GeV. The limits placed on several low-mass scalars extend previous exclusion limits in the range of proper lifetimes c tau from 5 cm to 1 m.

TI Search for new resonances in mass distributions of jet pairs using 139
   fb(-1) of pp collisions at √s=13TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A search for new resonances decaying into a pair of jets is reported using the dataset of proton-proton collisions recorded at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb(-1). The distribution of the invariant mass of the two leading jets is examined for local excesses above a data-derived estimate of the Standard Model background. In addition to an inclusive dijet search, events with jets identified as containing b-hadrons are examined specifically. No significant excess of events above the smoothly falling background spectra is observed. The results are used to set cross-section upper limits at 95% confidence level on a range of new physics scenarios. Model-independent limits on Gaussian-shaped signals are also reported. The analysis looking at jets containing b-hadrons benefits from improvements in the jet flavour identification at high transverse momentum, which increases its sensitivity relative to the previous analysis beyond that expected from the higher integrated luminosity.

TI Measurement of soft-drop jet observables in pp collisions with the ATLAS
   detector at √s=13 TeV
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Jet substructure quantities are measured using jets groomed with the soft-drop grooming procedure in dijet events from 32.9 fb(-1) of pp collisions collected with the ATLAS detector at √s=13 TeV. These observables are sensitive to a wide range of QCD phenomena. Some observables, such as the jet mass and opening angle between the two subjets which pass the soft-drop condition, can be described by a high-order (resummed) series in the strong coupling constant alpha(s). Other observables, such as the momentum sharing between the two subjets, are nearly independent of alpha(s). These observables can be constructed using all interacting particles or using only charged particles reconstructed in the inner tracking detectors. Track-based versions of these observables are not collinear safe, but are measured more precisely, and universal nonperturbative functions can absorb the collinear singularities. The unfolded data are directly compared with QCD calculations and hadron-level Monte Carlo simulations. The measurements are performed in different pseudorapidity regions, which are then used to extract quark and gluon jet shapes using the predicted quark and gluon fractions in each region. All of the parton shower and analytical calculations provide an excellent description of the data in most regions of phase space.

TI Searches for electroweak production of supersymmetric particles with
   compressed mass spectra in √s=13 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS
   detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB This paper presents results of searches for the electroweak production of supersymmetric particles in models with compressed mass spectra. The searches use 139 fb(-1) of √s=13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Events with missing transverse momentum and two same-flavor, oppositely charged, low-transverse-momentum leptons are selected, and are further categorized by the presence of hadronic activity from initial-state radiation or a topology compatible with vector-boson fusion processes. The data are found to be consistent with predictions from the Standard Model. The results are interpreted using simplified models of R-parity-conserving supersymmetry in which the lightest supersymmetric partner is a neutralino with a mass similar to the lightest chargino, the second-to-lightest neutralino, or the slepton. Lower limits on the masses of charginos in different simplified models range from 193 to 240 GeV for moderate mass splittings, and extend down to mass splittings of 1.5 to 2.4 GeV at the LEP chargino bounds (92.4 GeV). Similar lower limits on degenerate light-flavor sleptons extend up to masses of 251 GeV and down to mass splittings of 550 MeV. Constraints on vector-boson fusion production of electroweak SUSY states are also presented.

TI Z boson production in Pb plus Pb collisions at √s(NN)=5.02 TeV
   measured by the ATLAS experiment
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB The production yield of Z bosons is measured in the electron and muon decay channels in Pb+Pb collisions at /S-NN = 5.02 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Data from the 2015 LHC run corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.49 nb(-1) are used for the analysis. The Z boson yield, normalised by the total number of minimum-bias events and the mean nuclear thickness function, is measured as a function of dilepton rapidity and event centrality. The measurements in Pb+Pb collisions are compared with similar measurements made in proton-proton collisions at the same centre-of-mass energy. The nuclear modification factor is found to be consistent with unity for all centrality intervals. The results are compared with theoretical predictions obtained at next-to-leading order using nucleon and nuclear parton distribution functions. The normalised Z boson yields in Pb+Pb collisions lie 1-3a above the predictions. The nuclear modification factor measured as a function of rapidity agrees with unity and is consistent with a next-to-leading-order QCD calculation including the isospin effect.

TI Measurement of the Z(-> l(+)l(-))gamma production cross-section in pp
   collisions at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The production of a prompt photon in association with a Z boson is studied in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy √s=13 TeV. The analysis uses a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 139 fb(-1) collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC from 2015 to 2018. The production cross-section for the process pp -> l(+)l(-)gamma + X (l = e, mu) is measured within a fiducial phase-space region defined by kinematic requirements on the photon and the leptons, and by isolation requirements on the photon. An experimental precision of 2.9% is achieved for the fiducial cross-section. Differential cross-sections are measured as a function of each of six kinematic variables characterising the l(+)l(-)gamma system. The data are compared with theoretical predictions based on next-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations. The impact of next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections is also considered.

TI Search for direct stau production in events with two hadronic
   tau-leptons in √s=13 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A search for the direct production of the supersymmetric partners of tau-leptons (staus) in final states with two hadronically decaying tau-leptons is presented. The analysis uses a dataset of pp collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb(-1), recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant deviation from the expected Standard Model background is observed. Limits are derived in scenarios of direct production of stau pairs with each stau decaying into the stable lightest neutralino and one tau-lepton in simplified models where the two stau mass eigenstates are degenerate. Stau masses from 120 GeV to 390 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for a massless lightest neutralino.

TI Measurement of Azimuthal Anisotropy of Muons from Charm and Bottom
   Hadrons in pp Collisions at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS Detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The elliptic flow of muons from the decay of charm and bottom hadrons is measured in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV using a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 150 pb(-1) recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The muons from heavy-flavor decay are separated from light-hadron decay muons using momentum imbalance between the tracking and muon spectrometers. The heavy-flavor decay muons are further separated into those from charm decay and those from bottom decay using the distance-of-closest-approach to the collision vertex. The measurement is performed for muons in the transverse momentum range 4-7 GeV and pseudorapidity range vertical bar eta vertical bar < 2.4. A significant nonzero elliptic anisotropy coefficient nu(2) is observed for muons from charm decays, while the nu(2) value for muons from bottom decays is consistent with zero within uncertainties.

TI Search for electroweak production of charginos and sleptons decaying
   into final states with two leptons and missing transverse momentum in
   √s=13 TeV pp collisions using the ATLAS detector
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB A search for the electroweak production of charginos and sleptons decaying into final states with two electrons or muons is presented. The analysis is based on 139 fb(-1) of proton-proton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at √s=13 TeV. Three R-parity-conserving scenarios where the lightest neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle are considered: the production of chargino pairs with decays via eitherW bosons or sleptons, and the direct production of slepton pairs. The analysis is optimised for the first of these scenarios, but the results are also interpreted in the others. No significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations are observed and limits at 95% confidence level are set on the masses of relevant supersymmetric particles in each of the scenarios. For a massless lightest neutralino, masses up to 420 GeV are excluded for the production of the lightest-chargino pairs assuming W-boson-mediated decays and up to 1 TeV for slepton-mediated decays, whereas for slepton-pair production masses up to 700 GeV are excluded assuming three generations of mass-degenerate sleptons.

TI Measurement of the azimuthal anisotropy of charged-particle production
   in Xe plus Xe collisions at √s(NN)=5.44 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB This paper describes the measurements of flow harmonics v(2)-v(6) in 3 mu b(-1) of Xe Xe collisions at √s(NN)=5.44 TeV performed using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Measurements of the centrality, multiplicity, and p(T) dependence of the v(n) obtained using two-particle correlations and the scalar product technique are presented. The measurements are also performed using a template-fit procedure, which was developed to remove nonflow correlations in small collision systems. This nonflow removal is shown to have a significant influence on the measured v(n) at high p(T), especially in peripheral events. Comparisons of the measured v(n) with measurements in Pb + Pb collisions and p + Pb collisions at √s(NN)=5.02 TeV are also presented. The v(n) values in Xe + Xe collisions are observed to be larger than those in Pb + Pb collisions for n = 2, 3, and 4 in the most central events. However, with decreasing centrality or increasing harmonic order n, the v(n) values in Xe + Xe collisions become smaller than those in Pb + Pb collisions. The v(n) in Xe + Xe and Pb + Pb collisions are also compared as a function of the mean number of participating nucleons, < N-part >, and the measured charged-particle multiplicity in the detector. The v(3) values in Xe + Xe and Pb + Pb collisions are observed to be similar at the same < N-part > or multiplicity, but the other harmonics are significantly different. The ratios of the measured v(n) in Xe + Xe and Pb + Pb collisions, as a function of centrality, are also compared to theoretical calculations.

TI Search for the Higgs boson decays H -> ee and H -> e mu in pp collisions

AB Searches for the Higgs boson decays H -> ee and H -> e mu are performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb(-1) collected with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV at the LHC. No significant signals are observed, in agreement with the Standard Model expectation. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, the observed (expected) upper limit at the 95% confidence level on the branching fraction B(H -> ee) is 3.6 x 10(-4) (3.5 x 10(-4)) and on B(H -> e mu) is 6.2 x 10(-5) (5.9 x 10(-5)). These results represent improvements by factors of about five and six on the previous best limits on B(H -> ee) and B(H -> e mu) respectively.

TI Search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the bbl nu l nu
   final state with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB A search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production, as predicted by the Standard Model, is presented, where one of the Higgs bosons decays via the H -> bb channel and the other via one of the H -> WW*/ZZ*/tau tau channels. The analysis selection requires events to have at least two b-tagged jets and exactly two leptons (electrons or muons) with opposite electric charge in the final state. Candidate events consistent with Higgs boson pair production are selected using a multi-class neural network discriminant. The analysis uses 139 fb(-1) of pp collision data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. An observed (expected) upper limit of 1.2 (0.9(-0.3)(+0.4)) pb is set on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section at 95% confidence level, which is equivalent to 40 (29(-9)(+14)) times the value predicted in the Standard Model.

TI Search for displaced vertices of oppositely charged leptons from decays
   of long-lived particles in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS
   detector
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB A search for long-lived particles decaying into an oppositely charged lepton pair, mu mu, ee, or e mu, is presented using 32.8 fb(-1) of pp collision data collected at √s=13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Candidate leptons are required to form a vertex, within the inner tracking volume of ATLAS, displaced from the primary pp interaction region. No lepton pairs with an invariant mass greater than 12 GeV are observed, consistent with the background expectations derived from data. The detection efficiencies for generic resonances with lifetimes (c tau) of 100-1000 mm decaying into a dilepton pair with masses between 0.1-1.0 TeV are presented as a function of p(T) and decay radius of the resonances to allow the extraction of upper limits on the cross sections for theoretical models. The result is also interpreted in a supersymmetric model in which the lightest neutralino, produced via squark-antisquark production, decays into l(+) l'(-) nu(l, l' = e, mu) with a finite lifetime due to the presence of R-parity violating couplings. Cross-section limits are presented for specific squark and neutralino masses. For a 700 GeV squark, neutralinos with masses of 50-500 GeV and mean proper lifetimes corresponding to c tau values between 1 mm to 6 m are excluded. For a 1.6 TeV squark, c tau values between 3 mm to 1 m are excluded for 1.3 TeV neutralinos.

TI Measurement of differential cross sections for single diffractive
   dissociation in √s=8 TeV pp collisions using the ATLAS ALFA
   spectrometer
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A dedicated sample of Large Hadron Collider proton-proton collision data at centre-of-mass energy s= 8 TeV is used to study inclusive single diffractive dissociation, pp -> X p. The intact final-state proton is reconstructed in the ATLAS ALFA forward spectrometer, while charged particles from the dissociated system X are measured in the central detector components. The fiducial range of the measurement is -4.0 < log(10)xi < -1.6 and 0.016 < |t| < 0.43 GeV2, where xi is the proton fractional energy loss and t is the squared four-momentum transfer. The total cross section integrated across the fiducial range is 1.59 +/- 0.13 mb. Cross sections are also measured differentially as functions of xi, t, and increment eta, a variable that characterises the rapidity gap separating the proton and the system X . The data are consistent with an exponential t dependence, d sigma/dt proportional to e(Bt) with slope parameter B = 7.65 +/- 0.34 GeV-2. Interpreted in the framework of triple Regge phenomenology, the xi dependence leads to a pomeron intercept of alpha(0) = 1.07 +/- 0.09.

TI Transverse momentum and process dependent azimuthal anisotropies in
   √s(NN)=8.16 TeV p plus Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The azimuthal anisotropy of charged particles produced in sNN=8.16TeV p+Pb collisions is measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 165 nb-1 that was collected in 2016. Azimuthal anisotropy coefficients, elliptic v2 and triangular v3\, extracted using two-particle correlations with a non-flow template fit procedure, are presented as a function of particle transverse momentum (pT) between 0.5 and 50 GeV. The v2 results are also reported as a function of centrality in three different particle pTintervals. The results are reported from minimum-bias events and jet-triggered events, where two jet pT thresholds are used. The anisotropies for particles with pT less than about 2 GeV are consistent with hydrodynamic flow expectations, while the significant non-zero anisotropies for pT in the range 9-50 GeV are not explained within current theoretical frameworks. In the pTrange 2-9 GeV, the anisotropies are larger in minimum-bias than in jet-triggered events. Possible origins of these effects, such as the changing admixture of particles from hard scattering and the underlying event, are discussed.

TI Measurement of long-range two-particle azimuthal correlations in Z-boson
   tagged pp collisions at √s=8 and 13 TeV
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Results are presented from the measurement by ATLAS of long-range (|Delta eta|>2) dihadron angular correlations in √s=8 and 13 TeV pp collisions containing a Z boson. The analysis is performed using 19.4 fb-1 of √s=8 TeV data recorded during Run 1 of the LHC and 36.1 fb-1 of √s=13 TeV data recorded during Run 2. Two-particle correlation functions are measured as a function of relative azimuthal angle over the relative pseudorapidity range 2<|Delta eta|<5 for different intervals of charged-particle multiplicity and transverse momentum. The measurements are corrected for the presence of background charged particles generated by collisions that occur during one passage of two colliding proton bunches in the LHC. Contributions to the two-particle correlation functions from hard processes are removed using a template-fitting procedure. Sinusoidal modulation in the correlation functions is observed and quantified by the second Fourier coefficient of the correlation function, v2,2, which in turn is used to obtain the single-particle anisotropy coefficient v2. The v2 values in the Z-tagged events, integrated over 0.5<pT<5 GeV, are found to be independent of multiplicity and <mml:msqrt>s</mml:msqrt>, and consistent within uncertainties with previous measurements in inclusive pp collisions. As a function of charged-particle pT, the Z-tagged and inclusive v2 values are consistent within uncertainties for pT<3 GeV.

TI Search for Magnetic Monopoles and Stable High-Electric-Charge Objects in
   13 Tev Proton-Proton Collisions with the ATLAS Detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A search for magnetic monopoles and high-electric-charge objects is presented using 34.4 fb(-1) of 13 TeV pp collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC during 2015 and 2016. The considered signature is based upon high ionization in the transition radiation tracker of the inner detector associated with a pencil-shape energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The data were collected by a dedicated trigger based on the tracker high-threshold hit capability. The results are interpreted in models of Drell-Yan pair production of stable particles with two spin hypotheses (0 and 1/2) and masses ranging from 200 to 4000 GeV. The search improves by approximately a factor of 5 the constraints on the direct production of magnetic monopoles carrying one or two Dirac magnetic charges and stable objects with electric charge in the range 20 <= vertical bar z vertical bar <= 60 and extends the charge range to 60 < vertical bar z vertical bar <= 100.

TI Performance of electron and photon triggers in ATLAS during LHC Run 2
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Electron and photon triggers covering transverse energies from 5 GeV to several TeV are essential for the ATLAS experiment to record signals for a wide variety of physics: from StandardModel processes to searches for new phenomena in both proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. To cope with a fourfold increase of peak LHC luminosity from 2015 to 2018 (Run 2), to 2.1 x 10(34) cm(-2) s(-1), and a similar increase in the number of interactions per beam-crossing to about 60, trigger algorithms and selections were optimised to control the rates while retaining a high efficiency for physics analyses. For proton-proton collisions, the single-electron trigger efficiency relative to a single-electron offline selection is at least 75% for an offline electron of 31 GeV, and rises to 96% at 60 GeV; the trigger efficiency of a 25GeVleg of the primary diphoton trigger relative to a tight offline photon selection is more than 96% for an offline photon of 30 GeV. For heavy-ion collisions, the primary electron and photon trigger efficiencies relative to the corresponding standard offline selections are at least 84% and 95%, respectively, at 5 GeV above the corresponding trigger threshold.

AB This letter presents a combination of searches for Higgs boson pair production using up to 36.1 fb(-1) of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy √s=13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The combination is performed using six analyses searching for Higgs boson pairs decaying into the bbbb, bbW(+)W(-), bbtau(+)tau(-), W+W-W+W-, bb gamma gamma and W+W-gamma gamma final states. Results are presented for non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production modes. No statistically significant excess in data above the Standard Model predictions is found. The combined observed (expected) limit at 95% confidence level on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section is 6.9 (10) times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. Limits are also set on the ratio (kappa(lambda)) of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its Standard Model value. This ratio is constrained at 95% confidence level in observation (expectation) to -5.0 < kappa(lambda) < 12.0 (-5.8 < kappa(lambda) < 12.0). In addition, limits are set on the production of narrow scalar resonances and spin-2 Kaluza-Klein Randall-Sundrum gravitons. Exclusion regions are also provided in the parameter space of the habemus Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and the Electroweak Singlet Model.

TI Searches for lepton-flavour-violating decays of the Higgs boson in
   √s=13 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB This Letter presents direct searches for lepton flavour violation in Higgs boson decays, H -> e tau and H -> mu tau, performed with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The searches are based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy √s=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1). No significant excess is observed above the expected background from Standard Model processes. The observed (median expected) 95% confidence-level upper limits on the lepton-flavour-violating branching ratios are 0.47%(0.34(-0.10)(+0.13)%) and 0.28%(0.37(-0.10)(+0.14)%) for H -> e tau and H -> mu tau, respectively.

TI Search for flavour-changing neutral currents in processes with one top
   quark and a photon using 81 fb(-1) of pp collisions at √s=13 TeV
   with the ATLAS experiment
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB A search for flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) events via the coupling of a top quark, a photon, and an up or charm quark is presented using 81 fb(-1) of proton-proton collision data taken at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events with a photon, an electron or muon, a b-tagged jet, and missing transverse momentum are selected. A neural network based on kinematic variables differentiates between events from signal and background processes. The data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis, and limits are set on the strength of the tq gamma coupling in an effective field theory. These are also interpreted as 95% CL upper limits on the cross section for FCNC t gamma production via a left-handed (right-handed) tu gamma coupling of 36 fb (78 fb) and on the branching ratio for t -> gamma u of 2.8 x 10(-5) (6.1 x 10(-5)). In addition, they are interpreted as 95% CL upper limits on the cross section for FCNC t gamma production via a left-handed (right-handed) tc.coupling of 40 fb (33 fb) and on the branching ratio for t -> gamma c of 22 x 10(-5) (18 x 10(-5)).

TI Fluctuations of anisotropic flow in Pb plus Pb collisions at
   √s(NN)=5.02 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Multi-particle azimuthal cumulants are measured as a function of centrality and transverse momentum using 470 mu b(-1) of Pb+Pb collisions at √s(NN)=5.02 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. These cumulants provide information on the event-by-event fluctuations of harmonic flow coefficients v(n) and correlated fluctuations between two harmonics v(n) and v(m). For the first time, a non-zero four-particle cumulant is observed for dipolar flow, v(1). The four-particle cumulants for elliptic flow, v(2), and triangular flow, v(3), exhibit a strong centrality dependence and change sign in ultra-central collisions. This sign change is consistent with significant non-Gaussian fluctuations in v(2) and v(3). The four-particle cumulant for quadrangular flow, v(4), is found to change sign in mid-central collisions. Correlations between two harmonics are studied with three- and four-particle mixed-harmonic cumulants, which indicate an anti-correlation between v(2) and v(3), and a positive correlation between v(2) and v(4). These correlations decrease in strength towards central collisions and either approach zero or change sign in ultra-central collisions. To investigate the possible flow fluctuations arising from intrinsic centrality or volume fluctuations, the results are compared between two different event classes used for centrality definitions. In peripheral and mid-central collisions where the cumulant signals are large, only small differences are observed. In ultra-central collisions, the differences are much larger and transverse momentum dependent. These results provide new information to disentangle flow fluctuations from the initial and final states, as well as new insights on the influence of centrality fluctuations.

TI Combined measurements of Higgs boson production and decay using up to 80
   fb(-1) of proton-proton collision data at √s=13 TeV collected with
   the ATLAS experiment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Combined measurements of Higgs boson production cross sections and branching fractions arc presented. The combination is based on the analyses of the Higgs boson decay modes H -> gamma gamma, ZZ*, WW*, tau tau, bb, mu mu, searches for decays into invisible final states, and on measurements of off-shell Higgs boson production. Up to 79.8 fb(-1) of proton-proton collision data collected at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector are used. Results are presented for the gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion processes, and for associated production with vector bosons or top-quarks. The global signal strength is determined to be mu = 1.11(-0.08)(+0.09). The combined measurement yields an observed (expected) significance for the vector-boson fusion production process of 6.5 sigma (5.3 sigma). Measurements in kinematic regions defined within the simplified template cross section framework are also shown. The results are interpreted in terms of modifiers applied to the Standard Model couplings of the Higgs boson to other particles, and are used to set exclusion limits on parameters in two-Higgs-doublet models and in the simplified minimal supersynunetric Standard Model. No significant deviations from Standard Model predictions are observed.

TI Search for bottom-squark pair production with the ATLAS detector in
   final states containing Higgs bosons, b-jets and missing transverse
   momentum
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The result of a search for the pair production of the lightest supersymmetric partner of the bottom quark ((b) over tilde (1)) using 139 fb(-1) of proton-proton data collected at √s=13 TeV by the ATLAS detector is reported. In the supersymmetric scenarios considered both of the bottom-squarks decay into a b-quark and the second-lightest neutralino, (b) over tilde (1) -> b + (chi) over tilde (0)(2). Each (chi) over tilde (0)(2) is assumed to subsequently decay with 100% branching ratio into a Higgs boson (h) like the one in the Standard Model and the lightest neutralino: (chi) over tilde (0)(2) -> h + (chi) over tilde (0)(1). The (chi) over tilde (0)(1) is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and is stable. Two signal mass configurations are targeted: the first has a constant LSP mass of 60 GeV; and the second has a constant mass difference between the (chi) over tilde (0)(2) and (chi) over tilde (0)(1) of 130 GeV. The final states considered contain no charged leptons, three or more b-jets, and large missing transverse momentum. No significant excess of events over the Standard Model background expectation is observed in any of the signal regions considered. Limits at the 95% confidence level are placed in the supersymmetric models considered, and bottom-squarks with mass up to 1.5TeV are excluded.

TI Measurement of angular and momentum distributions of charged particles
   within and around jets in Pb plus Pb and pp collisions at
   √s(NN)=5.02 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB Studies of the fragmentation of jets into charged particles in heavy-ion collisions can provide information about the mechanism of jet quenching by the hot and dense QCD matter created in such collisions, the quark-gluon plasma. This paper presents a measurement of the angular distribution of charged particles around the jet axis in √s(NN)=5.02 TeV Pb + Pb and pp collisions, using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The Pb + Pb and pp data sets have integrated luminosities of 0.49 nb(-1) and 25 pb(-1), respectively. The measurement is performed for jets reconstructed with the anti-k(t) algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4 and is extended to an angular distance of r = 0.8 from the jet axis. Results are presented as a function of Pb + Pb collision centrality and distance from the jet axis for charged particles with transverse momenta in the 1- to 63-GeV range, matched to jets with transverse momenta in the 126- to 316-GeV range and an absolute value of jet rapidity of less than 1.7. Modifications to the measured distributions are quantified by taking a ratio to the measurements in pp collisions. Yields of charged particles with transverse momenta below 4 GeV are observed to be increasingly enhanced as a function of angular distance from the jet axis, reaching a maximum at r = 0.6. Charged particles with transverse momenta above 4 GeV have an enhanced yield in Pb + Pb collisions in the jet core for angular distances up to r = 0.05 from the jet axis, with a suppression at larger distances.

Corrections and calibrations that affect performance, including energy calibration, identification and isolation efficiencies, and the measurement of the charge of reconstructed electron candidates are determined using up to 81 fb(-1) of proton-proton collision data collected at √s=13 TeV between 2015 and 2017.

TI Measurement of K-S(0) and Lambda(0) production in tt dileptonic events
   in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Measurements of K-S(0) and Lambda(0) production in tt final states have been performed. They are based on a data sample with integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb(-1) from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, collected in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Neutral strange particles are separated into three classes, depending on whether they are contained in a jet, with or without a b-tag, or not associated with a selected jet. The aim is to look for differences in their main kinematic distributions. A comparison of data with several Monte Carlo simulations using different hadronisation and fragmentation schemes, colour reconnection models and different tunes for the underlying event has been made. The production of neutral strange particles in tt dileptonic events is found to be well described by current Monte Carlo models for K-S(0) and Lambda(0) production within jets, but not for those produced outside jets.

TI Measurement of flow harmonics correlations with mean transverse momentum
   in lead-lead and proton-lead collisions at √s(NN)=5.02 TeV with the
   ATLAS detector
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB To assess the properties of the quark gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic ion collisions, the ATLAS experiment at the LHC measures a correlation between the mean transverse momentum and the flow harmonics. The analysis uses data samples of lead-lead and proton-lead collisions obtained at the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV, corresponding to total integrated luminosities of 22 mu b(-1) and 28 mu b(-1), respectively. The measurement is performed using a modified Pearson correlation coefficient with the charged-particle tracks on an event-by-event basis. The modified Pearson correlation coefficients for the 2nd-, 3rd-, and 4th-order flow harmonics are measured in the lead lead collisions as a function of event centrality quantified as the number of charged particles or the number of nucleons participating in the collision. The measurements are performed for several intervals of the charged-particle transverse momentum. The correlation coefficients for all studied harmonics exhibit a strong centrality evolution, which only weakly depends on the charged-particle momentum range. In the proton lead collisions, the modified Pearson correlation coefficient measured for the 2nd-order flow harmonics shows only weak centrality dependence. The lead-lead data is qualitatively described by the predictions based On the hydrodynamical model.

TI Measurements of top-quark pair differential and double-differential
   cross-sections in the l plus jets channel with pp collisions at
   √s=13 TeV using the ATLAS detector
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Single- and double-differential cross-section measurements are presented for the production of top-quark pairs, in the lepton + jets channel at particle and parton level. Two topologies, resolved and boosted, are considered and the results are presented as a function of several kinematic variables characterising the top and tt system and jet multiplicities. The study was performed using data from pp collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 fb-1. Due to the large tt cross-section at the LHC, such measurements allow a detailed study of the properties of top-quark production and decay, enabling precision tests of several Monte Carlo generators and fixed-order Standard Model predictions. Overall, there is good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the data.

TI Measurement of the top-quark mass in tt 1-jet events collected with the

SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A determination of the top-quark mass is presented using 20.2 fb-1 of 8 TeV proton-proton collision data produced by the Large Hadron Collider and collected by the ATLAS experiment. The normalised differential cross section of top-quark pair production in association with an energetic jet is measured in the lepton+jets final state and unfolded to parton and particle levels. The unfolded distribution at parton level can be described using next-to-leading-order QCD predictions in terms of either the top-quark pole mass or the running mass as defined in the (modified) minimal subtraction scheme. A comparison between the experimental distribution and the theoretical prediction allows the top-quark mass to be extracted in the two schemes. The value obtained for the pole-mass scheme is:
   rnirle 171.1 0.4 (stat) 0.9 (syst) 173 (theo) GeV.
   The extracted value in the running-mass scheme is:
   rnt(rnt) = 162.9 0.5 (stat) 1.0 (syst) 1:12 (theo) GeV.
   The results for the top -quark mass using the two schemes are consistent, when translated from one scheme to the other.

The search is performed separately for electrons and muons in the final state. A distinguishing feature of the search is the use of large-radius jets containing electrons. Selections based on the signal topology result in smaller background compared to the expected signal. No significant deviation from the Standard Model prediction is observed and lower limits are set in the W-R and N-R mass plane. Mass values of the W-R smaller than 3.8-5 TeV are excluded for N-R in the mass range 0.1-1.8 TeV.

Finally, events with four leptons are analysed to search for WWZ > l nu l nu ll and WZZ > qqllll. Evidence for the joint production of three massive vector bosons is observed with a significance of 4.1 standard deviations, where the expectation is 3.1 standard deviations.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The algorithms used by the ATLAS Collaboration during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider to identify jets containing b-hadrons are presented. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated in the simulation and the efficiency with which these algorithms identify jets containing b-hadrons is measured in collision data. The measurement uses a likelihood-based method in a sample highly enriched in tt events. The topology of the t -> Wb decays is exploited to simultaneously measure both the jet flavour composition of the sample and the efficiency in a transverse momentum range from 20 to 600 GeV. The efficiency measurement is subsequently compared with that predicted by the simulation. The data used in this measurement, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 80.5 fb(-1), were collected in proton-proton collisions during the years 2015-2017 at a centre-of-mass energy √s=13 TeV. By simultaneously extracting both the efficiency and jet flavour composition, this measurement significantly improves the precision compared to previous results, with uncertainties ranging from 1 to 8% depending on the jet transverse momentum.

TI Measurement of W-+/- boson production in Pb plus Pb collisions at

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB A measurement of W-+/- boson production in Pb+Pb collisions at √s(NN)=5.02 TeV is reported using data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 0.49 nb(-1). The W-+/- bosons are reconstructed in the electron or muon leptonic decay channels. Production yields of leptonically decaying W-+/- bosons, normalised by the total number of minimum-bias events and the nuclear thickness function, are measured within a fiducial region defined by the detector acceptance and the main kinematic requirements. These normalised yields are measured separately for W+ and W- bosons, and are presented as a function of the absolute value of pseudorapidity of the charged lepton and of the collision centrality. The lepton charge asymmetry is also measured as a function of the absolute value of lepton pseudorapidity. In addition, nuclear modification factors are calculated using the W-+/- boson production cross-sections measured in pp collisions. The results are compared with predictions based on next-to-leading-order calculations with CT14 parton distribution functions as well as with predictions obtained with the EPPS16 and nCTEQ15 nuclear parton distribution functions. No dependence of normalised production yields on centrality and a good agreement with predictions are observed for mid-central and central collisions. For peripheral collisions, the data agree with predictions within 1.7 (0.9) standard deviations for W- (W+) bosons.

TI Search for heavy neutral leptons in decays of W bosons produced in 13
   TeV pp collisions using prompt and displaced signatures with the ATLAS
   detector
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The problems of neutrino masses, matter-antimatter asymmetry, and dark matter could be successfully addressed by postulating right-handed neutrinos with Majorana masses below the electroweak scale. In this work, leptonic decays of W bosons extracted from 32.9 fb(-1) to 36.1 fb(-1) of 13 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC are used to search for heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) that are produced through mixing with muon or electron neutrinos. The search is conducted using the ATLAS detector in both prompt and displaced leptonic decay signatures. The prompt signature requires three leptons produced at the interaction point (either mu mu e or ee mu) with a veto on same-flavour opposite-charge topologies. The displaced signature comprises a prompt muon from the W boson decay and the requirement of a dilepton vertex (either mu mu or mu e) displaced in the transverse plane by 4-300 mm from the interaction point. The search sets constraints on the HNL mixing to muon and electron neutrinos for HNL masses in the range 4.5-50 GeV.

TI Measurement of the inclusive isolated-photon cross section in pp
   collisions at √s=13 TeV using 36 fb(-1) of ATLAS data
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The differential cross section for isolated-photon production in pp collisions is measured at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1). The differential cross section is presented as a function of the photon transverse energy in different regions of photon pseudorapidity. The differential cross section as a function of the absolute value of the photon pseudorapidity is also presented in different regions of photon transverse energy. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations from Jetphox and Sherpa as well as next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD calculations from Nnlojet are compared with the measurement, using several parameterisations of the proton parton distribution functions. The predictions provide a good description of the data within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties.

TI Observation of Electroweak Production of a Same-Sign W Boson Pair in
   Association with Two Jets in pp Collisions √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS
   Detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB This Letter presents the observation and measurement of electroweak production of a same-sign W boson pair in association with two jets using 36.1 fb(-1) of proton-proton collision data recorded at a centerof-mass energy √s=13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis is performed in the detector fiducial phase-space region, defined by the presence of two same-sign leptons, electron or muon, and at least two jets with a large invariant mass and rapidity difference. A total of 122 candidate events are observed for a background expectation of 69 +/- 7 events, corresponding to an observed signal significance of 6.5 standard deviations. The measured fiducial signal cross section is sigma(fid) = 2.89(-0.48)(+0.51)(stat)(-0.28)(+0.29)(syst) fb.

TI Measurement of ZZ production in the ll nu nu final state with the ATLAS
   detector in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB This paper presents a measurement of ZZ production with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurement is carried out in the final state with two charged leptons and two neutrinos, using data collected during 2015 and 2016 in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1). The integrated cross-sections in the total and fiducial phase spaces are measured with an uncertainty of 7% and compared with Standard Model predictions, and differential measurements in the fiducial phase space are reported. No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed, and stringent constraints are placed on anomalous couplings corresponding to neutral triple gauge-boson interactions.

TI Measurement of fiducial and differential W+W- production cross-sections
   at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB A measurement of fiducial and differential cross-sections for W+W- production in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1) is presented. Events with one electron and one muon are selected, corresponding to the decay of the diboson system as WW -> e(+/-)nu mu(-/+)nu. To suppress top-quark background, events containing jets with a transverse momentum exceeding 35 GeV are not included in the measurement phase space. The fiducial cross-section, six differential distributions and the cross-section as a function of the jet-veto transverse momentum threshold are measured and compared with several theoretical predictions. Constraints on anomalous electroweak gauge boson self-interactions are also presented in the framework of a dimension-six effective field theory.

TI Identification of boosted Higgs bosons decaying into b-quark pairs with
   the ATLAS detector at 13 TeV
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB This paper describes a study of techniques for identifying Higgs bosons at high transverse momenta decaying into bottom-quark pairs, H -> bb, for proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy √s=13 TeV. These decays are reconstructed from calorimeter jets found with the anti-k(t) R = 1.0 jet algorithm. To tag Higgs bosons, a combination of requirements is used: b-tagging of R = 0.2 track-jets matched to the large-R calorimeter jet, and requirements on the jet mass and other jet substructure variables. The Higgs boson tagging efficiency and corresponding multijet and hadronic top-quark background rejections are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. Several benchmark tagging selections are defined for different signal efficiency targets. The modelling of the relevant input distributions used to tag Higgs bosons is studied in 36 fb(-1) of data collected in 2015 and 2016 using g -> bb and Z(-> bb)gamma event selections in data. Both processes are found to be well modelled within the statistical and systematic uncertainties.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The inclusive cross-section for jet production in association with a Z boson decaying into an electronpositron pair is measured as a function of the transverse momentum and the absolute rapidity of jets using 19.9 fb(-1) of √s=8 TeV proton-proton collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The measured Z + jets cross-section is unfolded to the particle level. The cross-section is compared with state-of-the-art Standard Model calculations, including the next-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations, corrected for non-perturbative and QED radiation effects. The results of the measurements cover final-state jets with transverse momenta up to 1 TeV, and show good agreement with fixed-order calculations.

TI Search for a heavy charged boson in events with a charged lepton and
   missing transverse momentum from pp collisions at √s=13 TeV with the
   ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A search for a heavy charged-boson resonance decaying into a charged lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino is reported. A data sample of 139 fb(-1) of proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC during 2015-2018 is used in the search. The observed transverse mass distribution computed from the lepton and missing transverse momenta is consistent with the distribution expected from the Standard Model, and upper limits on the cross section for pp -> W'-> lv are extracted (l = e or mu). These vary between 1.3 pb and 0.05 tb depending on the resonance mass in the range between 0.15 and 7.0 TeV at 95% confidence level for the electron and muon channels combined. Gauge bosons with a mass below 6.0 and 5.1 TeV are excluded in the electron and muon channels, respectively, in a model with a resonance that has couplings to fermions identical to those of the Standard Model W boson. Cross-section limits are also provided for resonances with several fixed Gamma/m values in the range between 1% and 15%. Model-independent limits are derived in single-bin signal regions defined by a varying minimum transverse mass threshold. The resulting visible cross-section upper limits range between 4.6 (15) ph and 22 (22) ab as the threshold increases from 130 (110) GeV to 5.1 (5.1) TeV in the electron (muon) channel.

TI Properties of jet fragmentation using charged particles measured with
   the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB This paper presents a measurement of quantities related to the formation of jets from high-energy quarks and gluons (fragmentation). Jets with transverse momentum 100 GeV < p(T) < 2.5 TeV and pseudorapidity vertical bar eta vertical bar < 2.1 from an integrated luminosity of 33 fb(-1) of √s=13 TeV proton-proton collisions are reconstructed with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Charged-particle tracks with p(T) > 500 MeV and vertical bar eta vertical bar < 2.5 are used to probe the detailed structure of the jet. The fragmentation properties of the more forward and the more central of the two leading jets from each event are studied. The data are unfolded to correct for detector resolution and acceptance effects. Comparisons with parton shower Monte Carlo generators indicate that existing models provide a reasonable description of the data across a wide range of phase space, but there are also significant differences. Furthermore, the data are interpreted in the context of quark- and gluon-initiated jets by exploiting the rapidity dependence of the jet flavor fraction. A first measurement of the charged-particle multiplicity using model-independent jet labels (topic modeling) provides a promising alternative to traditional quark and gluon extractions using input from simulation. The simulations provide a reasonable description of the quark-like data across the jet p(T) range presented in-this measurement, but the gluon-like data have systematically fewer charged particles than the simulation.

TI Search for diboson resonances in hadronic final states in 139 fb(-1) of
   pp collisions at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Narrow resonances decaying into WW, WZ or ZZ boson pairs are searched for in 139 fb(-1) of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of √s=13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider from 2015 to 2018. The diboson system is reconstructed using pairs of high transverse momentum, large-radius jets. These jets are built from a combination of calorimeter- and tracker-inputs compatible with the hadronic decay of a boosted W or Z boson, using jet mass and substructure properties. The search is performed for diboson resonances with masses greater than 1.3TeV. No significant deviations from the background expectations are observed. Exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio into dibosons for resonances in a range of theories beyond the Standard Model, with the highest excluded mass of a new gauge boson at 3.8TeV in the context of mass-degenerate resonances that couple predominantly to gauge bosons.

TI Search for high-mass dilepton resonances using 139 fb(-1) of pp
   collision data collected at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB A search for high-mass dielectron and dimuon resonances in the mass range of 250 GeV to 6TeV is presented. The data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-ofmass energy of √s=13 TeV during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb(-1). A functional form is fitted to the dilepton invariant-mass distribution to model the contribution from background processes, and a generic signal shape is used to determine the significance of observed deviations from this background estimate. No significant deviation is observed and upper limits are placed at the 95% confidence level on the fiducial cross-section times branching ratio for various resonance width hypotheses. The derived limits are shown to be applicable to spin-0, spin-1 and spin-2 signal hypotheses. For a set of benchmark models, the limits are converted into lower limits on the resonance mass and reach 4.5 TeV for the E-6-motivated Z(psi)' boson. Also presented are limits on Heavy Vector Triplet model couplings.
